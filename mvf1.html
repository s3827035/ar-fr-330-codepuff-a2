        <h1 class="text-center">Password and 2FA Support</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Nowadays, people have a large number of passwords for banking websites, social media, e-commerce, etc. It is important to use a secure and unique password for these websites, but it can be an overwhelming task to remember all these passwords. Using a software such as Passfree can make that task easier for you!</p>

        <p>Passfree will have support to store and manage passwords and 2FA keys. All of the information stored would be encrypted (with the help of a master password) to avoid the risk of leaks. With this feature, the users are sure that their personal details remains private to them as our software would encrypt all of their information and save it securely on a well protected cloud server.</p>

        <p>The main purpose of this feature is to provide the user with a password management system which isnâ€™t stored within their system, but rather in the cloud that will provide them with the option to access their accounts anywhere in the world.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Validation</h2>

        <p>In order to validate the usability of this feature, the user must set up an account at Passfree and then login to their account using their email address and password. After that, they must generate a password for a website such as Facebook and then save it in their profile. They should be able to access their password(s) anytime they wish using any device they would like to.</p>

        <p>Similarly, they should also add a 2FA key generated from a website such as Instagram and then use it to copy a 6-digit temporary code to login to their Instagram account.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Possible Errors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>When user is adding their password, they could accidentally leave it blank. The system would detect and show an error message asking them to check their entered password again.</li>
            <li>When the user adds their 2FA seed, the system would validate it and see if its valid. In case of a wrong seed, it would show an error message to the user to check their input.</li>
        </ul>
