        <h1 class="text-center">Export Password and Two-Factor Authentication Tokens</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Password and 2FA exporting will be a feature implemented in PassFree to allow users to freely access their passwords in plaintext or transfer data between devices.
        Most users over time will have multiple devices they may switch to or obtain new ones that will require them to input previous passwords again.
        Users may also opt to discontinue using the device and may choose to export all passwords stored into the current device and send it to another.</p>
		
        <p>Password and 2FA exporting will be coded primarily with PHP. Passwords that the user stores are saved as JSON formated files that are stored into PassFree databases
            created via SQL Database. When exporting, PassFree will first compress a JSON file containing all the passwords and 2FA tokens from the application database. Then PassFree
            will initialize an exporter to stream the file through the web and transfer the data to the designated device.
            Once recieved, all imported passwords will be unpacked and ready for use in the next device.
            For the users to access exporting features from PassFree, the application will ask for the Master Key in addition to a device security code. This is also connected to each device that the user
            has PassFree installed on. Each device will have a different security code to help the system differentiate between that are currently active. 
	    Lastly the system will also require the user to input the device security code of the device they are trying to export their passwords to.         
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
		
        <p>In order to validate the usability of this feature, the user must set up an account with Passfree and then login into their account using their email address and password. 
            After that they must generate a password for any website requiring login access and save it to their profile.</p>
        <p>To test this feature, the user should be able to click on the 'Export' button and be able to download a JSON file containing all their passwords.
            Before they can access this however, they must input their 'MasterKey' and device security code.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Possible Errors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>When user attempts to export passwords without entering the Master Key, The system would detect and show an error message asking them to check their entered Master Key again.</li>
            <li>When user negelcts to enter their Device Security Code, the system would detect and show an error message asking them to check their entered security code</li>
            <li>When user negelcts to enters a Device Security Code that is not connected to their account, the system would show an error message telling the user that they have entered an invalid Security Code.</li>
            <li>If the hosting server is offline and all the data is stored exclusively on the cloud backup then the user would not be able to export any of their information as there would be an error in communication to the server. To avoid this issue there would need to be local storage which would be considered the "live" storage for the data which can be relied on if the user decides to export and the host is offline. </li>
	    <li>As all the data is encrypted if there is an issue with the decryption access then the user would not be able to export the passwords and 2fa keys as plaintext or be able to export them at all. To avoid this the encryption and decryption under the master key section will need thorough testing. </li>
