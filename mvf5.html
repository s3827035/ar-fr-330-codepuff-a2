        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Password and 2FA exporting will be a feature implemented in PassFree to allow users to freely transfer passwords between devices for easier access.
        Most users will have multiple devices they may switch to or obtain new ones that will require them to input previous passwords again.
        Users may also opt to discontinue using this device and may choose to export all passwords stored into the current device and send it 
        to another.
        </p>
        <p>Password and 2FA exporting will be coded entirely with PHP. Passwords that the user stores are saved as JSON formated files that are stored into PassFree databases
            created via SQL Database. When exporting, PassFree will first compress a JSON file containing all the passwords and 2FA tokens from the application's database. Then, PassFree
            will initialize an exporter to stream the file through the web and transfer the data to the designated device.
            Once recieved, all imported passwords will be unpacked and ready for use in the next device.
            For the users to access exporting features from PassFree, the application will ask for the Master Key Along with this, a Device Security Code is also connected to each device that the user
            has PassFree installed. Each device will have a different security code to help the system differentiate each device that they are currently activated on, thus helping
            the system will also require the user to input the device security code of the device they are trying to export their passwords to.         
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>In order to validate the usability of this feature, the user must set up an account at Passfree and then login to their account using their email address and password. 
            After that, they must generate a password for any website requiring login access and then save it in their profile.</p>
        <p>To test this feature, the user should be able to click on the Export button and then be able to download a JSON file containing all their passwords.
            Before they can access this, however, they must input their Master Key and Device Security COde.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Possible Errors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>When user attempts to export passwords without entering the Master Key, The system would detect and show an error message asking them to check their entered Master Key again.</li>
            <li>When user negelcts to enter their Device Security Code, the system would detect and show an error message asking them to check their entered security code</li>
            <li>When user negelcts to enters a Device Security Code that is not connected to their account, the system would show an error message telling the user that they have entered an invalid Security Code.</li>
