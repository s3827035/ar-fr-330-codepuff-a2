        <h1 class="text-center">Web Application</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A web application is a downloadable software that runs on a webserver, and does not store or load files locally on a computer drive. Performing all the necessary tasks on the internet. PassFree will be coded primarily in PHP and ASP on the server side. The client-side will be coded with HTML5 and Javascript. Web applications will have a database connected to them to manage outgoing requests, store client information (usernames, passwords and bank details), and create tasks triggered by the user.
        </p>
        <p>The client-side interface will be used to manipulate information coming from the web server. Sending information towards the server, it will search through the databases and generate results based on the task requirements. This will produce the web application and responds back to the client. To extend fuctionality to the web application, seach engines such as chrome or firefox. Additionally, it will have the ability to create a web application as an extention within their browser. Adding functionality as well as accessability to the web application, users can expect features such as autofill or auto password. These additions can be easily coded with HTML5, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>To validate that what the user imputs are formatted, PHP will be used thoughout the whole form. As an example, there will be a script to make sure that the user does not enter any illegal characters, and then warn them of their mistake. Putting a 'space', or emojis in passwords usually does not work in databases. </p>
        <p>Other validation scripts that would be used will be to make sure that each form field will be validated. That means the user cannot input letters into their birthdate, or numbers into their bank names.</p>
        <p>The user should be able to acces the site once it has been hosted though a domain.</p>
        <p>The web application should connect to the database, and make sure that the data can be stored on the cloud.</p>

        <h2>Possible Errors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>If the user does not enter their details correctly or the confirming second entry does not match the first then the error message to notify the user will occur to check or re-try. </li>
            <li>When the user updates a password, they could forget to update it through passfree. The solution to this is for the web extention to ask the user if it can auto update a password.</li>
	    <li>500 Internal Server Error; one of the most common errors on a web page. This usually occurs with web server overload. When you encounter the error message a user would need to reload the webpage, which generally fixes the issue. If this error is constant or repetitive despite superficial solutions, it may be a hosting provider issue. To stay aligned to transparency, if this issue occurs the page will load the error message with this specific error. </li>
            <li>404 Not Found; this error message occurs when the web page does not exist. There are multiple reasons this may occur; however, it is most commonly due to human error in backend processing. This error can be avoided with thorough testing and strict monitoring of code updates to make sure everything is linked and connected to the server and the other aspects of the page are active. For the user, they will receive the error message. For a user they may refresh the page and see if that fixes the issue, else it would be up to the developers to monitor the running of the web application. </li>
            <li>408 Request Time-Out; this error occurs when the server does not receive the request entirely from the user in a set timeframe. This is generally a loading issue in which either the user or the server is experiencing a heavy workload or traffic peaks. If this issue persists or occurs then to avoid it on the server end, then the solution or prevention of this is to choose a server that can take multiple requests at once without overloading. The user will see the error message and can refresh their page and that generally will fix the issue. </li>
            <li>DNS queries are essential to web traffic management so if there is an issue then many issues will occur with the running the web application. It is the basis of many common website errors such as the 404. The best way to prevent this is to have DNS monitoring to identify the issue and to make sure the server is capable of the workload.</li>
