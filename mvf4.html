        <h1 class="text-center">Web Application</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A web application is an application software that runs on a webserver, and does not store or load files locally on a computer. Performing all the nessary tasks on the interenet, it will be coded in PHP and ASP from the server side. The host client will be coded in HTML5 and Javascript. Web applications will have a database connected to them to manage outgoing requests, store client information (usernames, passwords and bank details), and create tasks triggered by the clients.
        </p>
        <p>The client side interface will be used to manipulate information coming from the web server. Sending information towards the server, it will search though the datavases and generate resulsts based on the task requirements. This will produce the web application and responds back to the client. To extend fuctionality to the web application, seach engines such as chrome or firefox have the ability to create web application as an extention within their browser. Adding functionality as well as accessability to the web application, users can expect features such as autofill or auto password. These additions can be easily coded with HTML5, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>To validate that what the user imputs are formatted, PHP will be used thoughout the whole form. As an example, there will be a script to make sure that the user does not enter any illegal characters, and then warn them of their mistake. Putting a 'space', or emojis in passwords usually does not work in databases. </p>
        <p>Other validation scripts that would be used will be to make sure that each form field will be validated. That means the user cannot input letters into their birthdate, or numbers into their bank names.</p>
        <p>The user should be able to acces the site once it has been hosted though a domain.</p>
        <p>The web application should connect to the database, and make sure that the data can be stored on the cloud.</p>

        <h2>Possible Errors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>When inputing a new bank card, the user could accidently add too many or too little numbers. The form will notifiy the user asking them to check the card number again.</li>
            <li>When the user updates a password, they could forget to update it through passfree. The solution to this is for the web extention to ask the user if it can auto update a password.</li>
        </ul>
